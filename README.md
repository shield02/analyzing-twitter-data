## Wrangle and Analyze Data

### Introduction
Using Python and its libraries, the data was gathered from a variety of sources and in a 
variety of formats. The datasets was wrangled for quality and tidiness, then clean it. 
Then I documented all my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them 
through analyses and visualizations using Python and its libraries.

### Data Source
The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. 
These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always 
greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. 
WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
